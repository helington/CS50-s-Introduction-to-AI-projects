# **CS50's Introduction to AI with Python**  

This repository contains my solutions for [CS50's Introduction to AI with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/) course.  

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, machine learning, large language models, and other topics in artificial intelligence as they incorporate them into their own Python programs.  

By the end of the course, students emerge with experience in machine learning libraries and a solid understanding of artificial intelligence principles, enabling them to design their own intelligent systems.
